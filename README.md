# Digital Portfolio Creation Tool

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to check out my full-stack take home assignment!

## Overview

As requested, I've built a digital portfolio creation tool. Looking at the assignment, I decided to build a sort of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor with media file management.

The app is still rough around the edges, but I built it this way as a sort of proof-of-concept; the sort of thing that you would bring to the team after working on it for a few days to get feedback and rapidly iterate on until you get something more commercial.

I thought this would better mimic the real design process, which is why I opted to create something more advanced, even if it's not perfect.

## Design Philosophy

For the design aesthetic, I went with a Neumorphic inspired design (think Tesla vehicle UI). This seems to be a design trend that's sticking around for a while, and I thought it would be nice to go for something more stylized. The design could also use some refinement, but I think the classic depth effects and subtle visual language of the style is there.

I decided to keep the back-end simple and functional, as I wanted to focus a lot of time on the front-end features of the assignment since it's a digital portfolio, which to me strikes me as something very visual-focused.

If I could do it again, I might cut down on a few of the features I attempted to implement, but I am happy with the general ideas I think this proof-of-concept represents. I tried to be thoughtful with my UX choices in addition to my UI ones, putting relevant menus close to where the user would be looking and keeping UI elements minimal so the user could focus on the overall visual design of the portfolio.
